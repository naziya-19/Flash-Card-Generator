# Flash-Card-Generator
Flash Card Generator leverages advanced AI technology to streamline the study process. Users simply upload their files—whether they are lecture notes, study guides, or any other educational material—and our sophisticated backend uses state-of-the-art language models to analyze the content. The application then generates a series of custom flashcards, complete with questions and answers that are directly relevant to the content of the uploaded file.

<i>"Our application allows users to upload files and generates tailored questions and answers based on the content. While it does not use a traditional database for information retrieval, it utilizes the file's content as a dynamic source of information. This approach aligns with the principles of Retrieval-Augmented Generation by using the input (file content) as a basis for generative responses. Our system innovatively combines direct content processing with advanced AI generation techniques to deliver insightful outputs, demonstrating a novel application of RAG principles in a unique context."</i>
