<i>"Our application allows users to upload files and generates tailored questions and answers based on the content. While it does not use a traditional database for information retrieval, it utilizes the file's content as a dynamic source of information. This approach aligns with the principles of Retrieval-Augmented Generation by using the input (file content) as a basis for generative responses. Our system innovatively combines direct content processing with advanced AI generation techniques to deliver insightful outputs, demonstrating a novel application of RAG principles in a unique context."</i>
